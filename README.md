## 📌 Introduction

Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication is key to intelligent transportation systems (ITS), enabling real-time data exchange between vehicles to enhance road safety, traffic efficiency, and emergency responsiveness.

Traditional technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth suffer from limited range and high power consumption. This project explores the use of **LoRa** (Long Range) technology to implement an energy-efficient, long-range V2V communication system.

## 🚧 Problem Statement

Road accidents remain a major concern globally due to the lack of real-time vehicular communication. Current systems rely heavily on infrastructure, causing delays in sharing critical alerts. Our goal is to design a direct V2V communication method that:

- Prevents accidents via real-time alerts
- Improves response time for emergency services
- Reduces dependence on centralized infrastructure

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a V2V communication system using LoRa modules
- Ensure reliable, low-latency data exchange
- Support both V2V and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication
- Implement peer-to-peer and mesh networking architectures
- Enable modular integration with existing vehicle systems

## 🔍 Literature Survey

1. **Evaluation of LoRaWAN for V2V Communication** – L. Cerqueira et al., 2019  
   Evaluates LoRaWAN's performance for V2V scenarios and proves its suitability at low transmission power.

2. **LoRaWAN-based V2V for Intersection Collision Avoidance** – Z. Zhang et al., 2020  
   Proposes collision warning systems at intersections using LoRaWAN with promising results.
